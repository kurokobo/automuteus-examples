## Procedure

### Update `libseccomp2` and `libseccomp-dev`

This procedure is required on Buster-based Raspberry Pi OS only. See [the appendix](#appendix-explanation-of-the-issue-with-libseccomp-on-buster-on-arm-platform) for more details.

```bash
# Add Buster-based backport repository
echo "deb <http://deb.debian.org/debian> buster-backports main contrib non-free" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list

# Import public keys for new backport repository
sudo curl -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/archive-key-10.asc <https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys/archive-key-10.asc>

# Update libseccomp2 and libseccomp-dev
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -t buster-backports -y libseccomp2 libseccomp-dev
```

### Build `automuteus` container image and run AutoMuteUs

Prepare required files.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/automuteus/automuteus.git
git clone https://github.com/automuteus/deploy.git
```

Then provide your specific Environment Variables in the `.env` file under `deploy` directory, as relevant to your configuration. See [the Environment Variables reference on the `README.md` on `deploy` repository](https://github.com/automuteus/deploy#environment-variables) for details, as well as the `sample.env` file under `deploy` directory provided.

Then modify your `docker-compose.yml` under `deploy` directory by commenting out the line `image: automuteus/automuteus:${AUTOMUTEUS_TAG:?err}` and uncommenting the `build: ../automuteus`.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  automuteus:
    # Either:
    # - Use a prebuilt image
    #image: automuteus/automuteus:${AUTOMUTEUS_TAG:?err}     ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
    # - Use an old prebuilt image (prior to 6.16.1)
    #image: denverquane/amongusdiscord:${AUTOMUTEUS_TAG:?err}
    # - Build image from local source
    build: ../automuteus     ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
    # - Build image from github directly
    #build: https://github.com/automuteus/automuteus.git
    ...
```

Next, pull related images and build your `automuteus` container.

```bash
cd ~/deploy
docker-compose pull
docker-compose build
```

Finally, start it up.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If your Redis or PostgreSQL are stucked for some reason, reset AutoMuteUs by deleting related volumes. Note that the command `docker-compose down --volumes` in this procedure will remove all volumes including database used by AutoMuteUs.

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
docker-compose up -d
```

## Appendix: Explanation of the issue with `libseccomp` on Buster on ARM platform

On the Buster-based Raspberry Pi OS, `redis:6-alpine` and `postgres:12-alpine` used in AutoMuteUs don't work correctry.

The technical details for these problems can be found in the release notes of [Alpine](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Release_Notes_for_Alpine_3.13.0#musl_1.2) and related [musl](https://musl.libc.org/time64.html). In short, the system call for time on 32-bit systems has changed and it is no longer well handled by the old `libseccomp` on the container host side. Since the latest PostgreSQL and Redis used this system call indirectly, it no longer work well.

The latest `libseccomp` in the repository for Buster-based Raspberry Pi OS is a bit outdated (`2.3.3-4`) to solve these problems, so we will need update related packages by using backport repository as described above.

## Appendix: To use v7 on Raspberry Pi (Experimental)

In the current v7 implementation, AutoMuteUs may not start properly on Raspberry Pi. This is due to the high load on limited hardware resources during startup causing some of the internal processing to time out.

The timeout is hardcoded and cannot be extended without modifying the code.

As a workaround to avoid high load at startup, start Redis and PostgreSQL first, and wait a little while before starting the rest of the services.

```bash
docker-compose up -d redis postgres
sleep 30
docker-compose up -d automuteus galactus
sleep 30
docker-compose up -d wingman
```

For technical information, see [the issue on Galactus](https://github.com/automuteus/galactus/issues/12).
